## Milestone 1

Group 6
9/29/2020

* **Vision**: Our vision is to change the way local people in our area order take out food.
    * Our vision is to implement an improved version of the online take out system for fast food restaurants. We will include a simplified yet efficient service for ordering take out from a majority of restaurants and fast food places.
    * We will also include a point reward system for attracting consumers to using our product. By doing so we also increase customers for each restaurant included and incentivize a profit from doing so.
    * We will provide the ability to save common orders so as to allow users to order their food in less time and with less difficulty.
    * We expect our product to revolutionize the online take out industry while keeping our product simple and safe for all consumers to use. Grubhub is much too expensive and including a take out option complements our product with those such as Grubhub.
    * Written by: Caleb Givens
* **Mission**:  Our plan for achieving our goals 
    * As a team we will work together to make decisions that will affect the project outcome and features.
    * We will meet using either Microsoft Teams or Discord, depending on what is most convenient at the time, and meetings will occur regularly 1-2 times per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
    * Additional meetings will be held throughout the week as needed. 
    * We will plan to complete our project in different phases, which will include planning, programming, testing/analysis, and retrospective.
    * While we will have established time slots for completing each phase, they will be adjusted as needed during the regular meetings
    * Any changes to the plan of the project will be communicated ASAP to all members of the group via instant messaging and through voice chat if at possible
    * Written by: Kollin Labowski
* **Success Criteria**: Our guide to success
    * Customers will be able to earn points from each order they place, the amount of points they will earn will depend on what items they order.
    * Customers will be able to create an account that can save their information making repeated ordering quick and simple. Along with creating an account users will be able to save orders, for example a customer throws frequent parties where they always order a certain pizza and wings. Under their account they will be able to save this with a custom name of their choosing, so that future orders can be placed with a single click.
    * Our product will help decrease the amount of users spend ordering food from various restaurants by combining all their menus into one system and allowing the user to have one account instead of an account for each restaurant.
    * Our system will allow users to give feedback about the features so that the system can continuously be improved.

## Milestone 4
**What went well in the Sprint?**
In this sprint, the team solidified the goals of the project and gained a more uniform, clear vision of where the project needs to go in future sprints. Every member of the group contributed to the project and was eager to introduce new ideas to the project. Each member completed their contribution to the project in a timely manner so that everything could be compiled together for presenting it. The group members all did a very good job of communicating so that no two members were performing the same work and that no specific jobs were left out by mistake. As a whole, the team was very cohesive and tackled each obstacle without any excessive difficulty.

**What could be improved?**
The biggest issue that came about during the first coding sprint was having a workspace that everyone could work in without causing other people issues. Since we hadn’t learned about the AWS service yet we had to each write our own portions of code and determine global variable names so that everyone's code would integrate together. Then each person uploaded their portion of code then one member of the team compiled the project into one file with each portion integrated into the final version of the sprint. In the next sprint we will integrate in AWS so that everyone can work on the project in real time and quickly see how their code interacts with each other.

**What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?**
We will commit to improve the functionality by implementing more user friendly features such as logging in and having a profile. We will also improve and complete placing an order and checking out on the website. Our most important improvements will start and include integrating our code into AWS so that we can all work more efficiently and keep our work consistent. We plan to also focus on building the aesthetics of the website in order to attract consumers and keep a professional look. We would direct our attention from a grubhub knockoff to a more inclusive restaurant review and suggestion website for other students in the area! We’ll focus on having user suggestive implementations as well as an interactive map for a better UI directed towards attracting consumers.
